**Opening and Setting Context:**

Namaste. Today, we gather to explore the profound theme of compassion as illuminated by the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita. Compassion, in its essence, is the ability to be kind to ourselves and others, a cornerstone of our spiritual practice. As intermediate practitioners, many of us are familiar with the drive to perfect our asanas, to reach that elusive peak pose. However, it is essential to cultivate a balance between desire and obsession. Let us be reminded that true progress lies in being kind and patient with ourselves on this journey.

**Main Teaching Points:**

**1. Compassion for the Self:**

The Bhagavad Gita teaches us that self-compassion is fundamental to our spiritual growth. In Chapter 6, Verse 5, it says, "One must elevate, not degrade, oneself by one's own mind. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well." This verse highlights the importance of treating ourselves with kindness. Imagine striving for a challenging pose like Bakasana (Crow Pose). It’s crucial to recognize our current abilities and limitations. Instead of forcing our bodies, we should listen to them, embracing where we are today without judgment.

**2. Compassion in Practice:**

The second teaching point involves extending compassion to our practice itself. In our quest for mastery, we may become fixated on achieving the perfect pose, neglecting the journey. In the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 47, Krishna advises, "You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions." This wisdom reminds us that our focus should be on the effort, not the outcome. Consider a practitioner working towards the Handstand. Instead of obsessing over the end goal, they can appreciate each small victory along the way, practicing with grace and patience.

**3. Compassion for Others:**

Finally, compassion should extend beyond ourselves to those around us. The Gita, in Chapter 12, Verse 13, beautifully describes the compassionate soul: "He who hates no creature, who is friendly and compassionate to all..." This teaching invites us to approach our peers with empathy, especially when they struggle or succeed in their own practices. Imagine a classmate who effortlessly achieves a pose you find challenging. Instead of envy, let us cultivate joy for their success, understanding that each of us moves at our own pace.

**Practice or Meditation Guidance:**

Let us now engage in a brief meditation to deepen our understanding of compassion. Please find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, release any tension in your body. Reflect on a pose you have been striving to achieve. Gently ask yourself: "Am I being compassionate to myself in this pursuit?" Visualize approaching your practice with kindness, celebrating each step. Consider a time you witnessed another's success. How did you respond? Allow feelings of joy for others to fill your heart. Breathe deeply, and when you are ready, slowly open your eyes.

**Closing and Integration:**

In summary, compassion is an essential element of our spiritual journey, as taught in the Bhagavad Gita. We must strive for our aspirations without becoming obsessed, nurturing kindness towards ourselves and others. Remember, every step in your practice is valuable, and every person’s journey is unique. As we leave today, let us carry the spirit of compassion into our lives, allowing it to guide our actions and thoughts. In the words of the Gita, may we always act with a heart full of love and understanding. Thank you for being part of this sacred exploration. Namaste.
